# Neural-Network-Library
A simple library for creating artificial neural networks using C++.

I am creating this collection of code as a way of developing a thorough understanding of neural network AI. If you are looking for well-written and highly optimized code, then
this library is probably not what you're looking for. If you notice any issues or potential improvements in the code, Feedback and constructive criticism are welcome.
